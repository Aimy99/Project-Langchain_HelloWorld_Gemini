# Project 01-Langchain_HelloWorld_Gemini
Integrated Langchain &amp; Gemini API code for fetching responses from the AI model

This project is **PIAIC Quarter 3 - Project 01** by Aiman Baquar, titled "Langchain_hello_gemini." It demonstrates the usage of Langchain with Google's Gemini model to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Key Components
1. **Langchain Installation**: The necessary libraries for Langchain, Langchain_community, and the Google Gemini SDK are installed.
2. **API Key Setup**: The project uses an API key to securely connect to the Gemini API for model access.
3. **Model Features**: Langchain is used to create more complex applications, allowing users to chain LLM calls, integrate external data sources, and create AI-driven agents.

## Methods
1. **Method 1**: Using Langchain with a prompt to generate responses from the model.
2. **Method 2**: Creating a custom prompt template and chaining LLM responses for complex tasks.
3. **Styling**: The generated responses are styled in markdown format for better readability.
